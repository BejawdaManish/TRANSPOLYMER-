# TRANSPOLYMER-

The TransPolymer model is a Transformer-based AI system designed to predict polymer properties more accurately and efficiently. It uses a special tokenization method to better understand polymer structures and is trained on a large dataset using Masked Language Modeling (MLM). Because of this, TransPolymer performs better than other models across multiple datasets.
In conclusion, this model can be a powerful tool for polymer research and virtual material discovery, helping scientists find new materials faster and more effectively
